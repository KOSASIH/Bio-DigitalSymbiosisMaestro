Output:
```
# Implement a markdown code generator function

This function takes in a dictionary of task details and generates a markdown code snippet with the provided task details.

```python
def generate_markdown_code(task_details):
    markdown_code = ""
    # Add task title
    markdown_code += f"# {task_details['title']}

    # Add task description
    markdown_code += f"{task_details['description']}

    # Add task code
    markdown_code += "```python
    markdown_code += f"{task_details['code']}

    return markdown_code
```
