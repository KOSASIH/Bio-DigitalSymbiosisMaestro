# Task Scheduler Algorithm

The task scheduler algorithm aims to optimize the allocation of tasks between humans and AI based on various factors such as task complexity, AI capabilities, human expertise, and workload distribution. The algorithm follows a set of steps to determine the most suitable assignment for each task.

## Inputs
- List of tasks: Each task contains information such as task ID, task complexity, and required expertise.
- List of available AI agents: Each AI agent has information about its capabilities and workload.
- List of available human agents: Each human agent has information about their expertise and workload.

## Outputs
- Assignment of tasks to either AI agents or human agents.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize an empty assignment list to store the task assignments.
2. Sort the list of tasks based on their complexity in ascending order.
3. For each task in the sorted list:
   - Check the workload of available AI agents and human agents.
   - Calculate a suitability score for each available agent based on their expertise and workload.
   - Assign the task to the agent with the highest suitability score.
   - Update the workload of the assigned agent.
   - Add the task assignment to the assignment list.
4. Return the assignment list.

## Pseudocode

```python
function schedule_tasks(tasks, ai_agents, human_agents):
    assignment_list = []

    # Sort tasks based on complexity
    sorted_tasks = sort_tasks_by_complexity(tasks)

    for task in sorted_tasks:
        best_agent = None
        best_score = -1

        for agent in ai_agents + human_agents:
            if agent.workload < agent.max_workload:
                score = calculate_suitability_score(agent, task)
                if score > best_score:
                    best_score = score
                    best_agent = agent

        if best_agent is not None:
            best_agent.workload += 1
            assignment_list.append((task, best_agent))

    return assignment_list

def calculate_suitability_score(agent, task):
    # Calculate suitability score based on expertise, workload, and other factors
    score = agent.expertise * (1 - agent.workload_factor) + task.complexity * task.priority_factor
    return score

def sort_tasks_by_complexity(tasks):
    # Sort tasks based on complexity in ascending order
    sorted_tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda x: x.complexity)
    return sorted_tasks
```

Please note that this is a high-level representation of the algorithm's logic and pseudocode. You may need to adapt and modify it according to your specific requirements and programming language.

```python
import random
import string

def generate_random_string(length):
    """
    Generates a random string of characters with a specified length.

    Args:
        length (int): The length of the random string to generate.

    Returns:
        str: The randomly generated string.
    """
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    random_string = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    return random_string
```

This function utilizes the `random` module in Python to generate a random string of characters. It takes in a parameter `length` which specifies the desired length of the random string. The function then creates a string `characters` that includes all possible characters that can be used in the random string. It uses a loop to randomly select characters from the `characters` string and concatenates them to form the final random string of the specified length. The function returns the randomly generated string.

```python
import nltk
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def calculate_similarity(doc1, doc2):
    # Tokenize the documents into words
    nltk.download('punkt')
    doc1_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(doc1)
    doc2_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(doc2)
    
    # Combine the tokens into sentences
    doc1_sentence = ' '.join(doc1_tokens)
    doc2_sentence = ' '.join(doc2_tokens)
    
    # Create a TF-IDF vectorizer
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    
    # Fit and transform the documents into TF-IDF vectors
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([doc1_sentence, doc2_sentence])
    
    # Calculate the cosine similarity between the vectors
    similarity_score = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0], tfidf_matrix[1])[0][0]
    
    return similarity_score

# Example usage
document1 = "This is the first document."
document2 = "This document is the second document."
similarity = calculate_similarity(document1, document2)
print(f"The similarity between the two documents is: {similarity}")
```

This code snippet defines a function `calculate_similarity` that takes two text documents as input and calculates their similarity using the TF-IDF technique. It uses the NLTK library to tokenize the documents into words and then combines them into sentences. The function then creates a TF-IDF vectorizer and fits and transforms the documents into TF-IDF vectors. Finally, it calculates the cosine similarity between the vectors and returns the similarity score.

To use this function, you can pass in two text documents and it will return a similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the documents are identical and 0 indicates no similarity. In the example usage provided, the similarity between the two documents is printed.

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

def sentiment_analysis(text):
    # Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
    model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3)

    # Tokenize and encode the input text
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, add_special_tokens=True)
    attention_mask = [1] * len(input_ids)

    # Convert the inputs to PyTorch tensors
    input_ids = torch.tensor([input_ids])
    attention_mask = torch.tensor([attention_mask])

    # Perform inference
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)

    # Get the predicted sentiment label
    logits = outputs[0]
    predicted_label = torch.argmax(logits).item()

    # Map the predicted label to sentiment class
    sentiment_classes = {0: "Negative", 1: "Neutral", 2: "Positive"}
    sentiment = sentiment_classes[predicted_label]

    return sentiment
```

This code snippet defines a function `sentiment_analysis` that performs sentiment analysis on a given text using a pre-trained BERT model. The function takes a text input and returns the sentiment label as either "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral".

To use this function, you will need to install the `transformers` library and have a pre-trained BERT model available. The function utilizes the Hugging Face `transformers` library, which provides easy access to pre-trained models and tokenizers.

Note that this code assumes you already have a pre-trained BERT model available. If not, you can download one from the Hugging Face model hub or train your own model using a suitable dataset.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag
from nltk.chunk import ne_chunk

def extract_keywords(text):
    # Tokenize the text into sentences
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the keywords
    keywords = []
    
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Tokenize the sentence into words
        words = word_tokenize(sentence)
        
        # Remove stopwords and punctuation
        words = [word.lower() for word in words if word.isalpha() and word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english')]
        
        # Perform part-of-speech tagging
        pos_tags = pos_tag(words)
        
        # Extract named entities
        named_entities = ne_chunk(pos_tags)
        
        # Iterate over the named entities and add them to the keywords list
        for entity in named_entities:
            if hasattr(entity, 'label') and entity.label() == 'NE':
                keywords.append(' '.join(c[0] for c in entity))
    
    return keywords
```

This function takes a text as input and extracts the keywords using natural language processing techniques such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. It uses the NLTK library for tokenization, stopword removal, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

The function first tokenizes the input text into sentences using the `sent_tokenize` function. Then, it iterates over each sentence and tokenizes it into words using the `word_tokenize` function. It removes stopwords and punctuation from the words list.

Next, it performs part-of-speech tagging on the words using the `pos_tag` function. This assigns a part-of-speech tag to each word, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

Then, it applies named entity recognition using the `ne_chunk` function. This identifies named entities in the text, such as person names, organization names, etc. It iterates over the named entities and adds them to the keywords list.

Finally, it returns the list of extracted keywords.

You can use this function to extract keywords from a given text for tasks such as text summarization or topic extraction.
